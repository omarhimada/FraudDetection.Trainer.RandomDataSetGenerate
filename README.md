Genereate realistic synthetic login events in order to train an ML model for fraud detection. 
Similar to Incubation, I'm going to add it to the pipeline and train fraud detection models along with my customer recommmendations, churn predictions, and segmentation.

Example image output. The CSV is only 18.1 MB with 56,000 rows. I tried a more enterprise value for 'login events each day' and the CSV got too large to even upload. When this is deployed as a class library within a deployable system (like https://adosiml.com),
it will be much easier to train with ~1,000,000 rows as an example.

See example output CSV for ML data ingestion:
